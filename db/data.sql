Emotional Schema Therapy is an integrative, social cognitive model that proposes that problems arise as a result of evaluations, interpretations, and predictions about emotional experience that result in problematic coping strategies. For example, an adaptive interpretation of sadness and anger after a breakup would include normalizing the emotion, viewing the emotion as temporary, relating the emotion to values of intimacy, and validating one’s own experience. However, our research shows that depression, anxiety, worry, rumination, avoidance, and indecisiveness are the result of viewing one’s emotions as lasting indefinitely, out of control, abnormal, shameful, incomprehensible and unacceptable. These beliefs result in unhelpful emotion regulation strategies that perpetuate the negative beliefs about one’s emotions. In this workshop we will cover the fundamental Emotional Schema Therapy Model, techniques and conceptualisations that address the major dysfunctional emotional schemas, experiential and cognitive techniques to cope with emotional experience, and methods to enhance emotional enrichment, differentiation and emotional intelligence. This will include discussion of Emotional Perfectionism, Existential Perfectionism, “Pure Mind”, Intolerance of Ambivalence, Constructive Discomfort, Successful Imperfection, and Personal Empowerment. In addition, we will discuss how an Emotional Schema conceptualization can assist in understanding how emotional socialization, current beliefs about emotion, and current unhelpful strategies often limit the individual in developing a fully enriched life.

The Emotional Schema Model can assist CBT practitioners in assisting clients in enriching their emotional experience, learning from their emotions, relating their emotions to their values, and developing productive strategies for coping with emotions.

These difficulties are often described as Complex PTSD and at the heart of the distress are fragmented shame fuelled flashbacks/ trauma memories which are maintained by self-attacking thoughts/ self-blame and further perpetuate distress. Evidence based practice such a trauma focused CBT can sometime feel less effective with shame based trauma presentations, where clients report a ‘heart-head’ lag; they don’t feel on an emotional level what they know on an intellectual level(Lee, 2005). Furthermore emerging research demonstrates that experiences of shame and self-criticism respond less well to more traditional CBT approaches (Gilbert, 2009) but benefit more from compassion focused approaches (Kirby,Tellegen & Steindl, 2017, Beaumont, E).  These findings, as well as clinical developments in treating shame based trauma and Complex PSTD have emphasised the need to develop compassionate minds as an antidote to shame based states and moreover to bring into shame based memories, a felt sense of compassion (Lee, 2013).

The focus of this workshop will be to explore how to bring compassion to shame- based flashbacks memories as well as learn how to develop compassionate antidotes to shame based trauma narratives, in order to promote recovery and resolution from distressing symptoms of PTSD and Complex PTSD. The approach builds on evidence based practice such as trauma focused CBT (Ehlers & Clarke 2000) and Imagery Recripting (Arntz, 2012)

Compassion focused therapy was developed by Professor Paul Gilbert. The explicit goal is to develop, access and stimulate positive affect associated with self-soothing in the mind and body of the patient in order to promote an inner sense of psychological safeness (Gilbert, 2005, 2009).

Within current protocols, treatments for these negative images include video feedback and behavioural experiments, both of which aim at helping people to develop a realistic view of how they appear to others. However, negative views of self are not limited to other people’s judgments and they can be entrenched and hard to change.  In general, negative self-images derive from experiences such as neglect, abuse, bullying, and abandonment (Hinrichsen, Morrison,Waller, & Schmidt, 2007; Patel, Brewin, Wheatley, Wells, & Myers, 2007; Wells & Hackmann, 1993). The images then help to maintain a vicious cycle of self-criticism, behavioral change (e.g.,avoidance, withdrawal), and disturbing physiological and emotional responses. In social anxiety disorder, negative self-images often drive a range of specific safety behaviours, such as intense self-monitoring and internal rehearsal of thoughts/behaviours, together with self-focused attention, all of which can significantly interfere with social performance.

​There is growing evidence that imagery rescripting helps people to re-evaluate and change negative views of self across a range of disorders including social anxiety disorder  (Morina, Lancee, & Arntz, 2017; Stopa, 2011; Wild, Hackmann, & Clark, 2007, 2008). There is also experimental evidence that positive images of the self derived from autobiographical memories can produce short term reductions in social anxiety, improve actual and perceived social performance and enhance self-esteem (Stopa, Brown, & Hirsch, 2012; Ng, Abbott, & Hunt, 2014). In this workshop, we will look at imagery rescripting, consider the evidence for its efficacy, and learn how to apply it in the treatment of an individual with social anxiety disorder.

Although anxiety and worry are important and frequent, people also respond to uncertainty with frustration, anger, guilt, as well as loss and anticipated loss and sadness.

Bringing together three established models, this CBT workshop will provide a framework to think about the contributions of threat and uncertainty to distress.  First, the classic cognitive model of anxiety helps us understand the roles of actual threat and overestimation of threat. Second, the model of perceived uncertainty developed in the context of long-term illness helps understand how actual uncertainty can become inflated through various perceptual processes and behaviours. Third, current models of intolerance of uncertainty help us understand how disruption due to changes in peoples’ lives leads to increased perceptions of both threat and uncertainty.  While the dominant point of reference has been the pandemic, the model is also relevant to any situation with elements of threat and uncertainty, including serious illness, caregiving in conditions like dementia, vaccines, long covid and climate change. While the sources of threat and uncertainty will differ in content, the processes will remain the same.  So, uncertainty can be experienced both individually and collectively, and the model can help us understand both.

The earlier part of the workshop will cover the interventions from our workshops in the first nine months of the pandemic that can help reduce the distress by decreasing perceptions of threat and especially uncertainty.  Early interventions include managing information and building safety to counter the disruption and information overload associated with the pandemic.  Then some of the classic anxiety interventions can be used to target overestimation of threat, although in real-world situations the distress may be proportionate rather than excessive as in clinical anxiety. Finally, interventions recently developed for intolerance of uncertainty in anxiety disorders can help produce greater resilience.

​The latter part of the workshop will address some newer ideas we have been considering more and more through 2021 and which we think will still be relevant in 2022 and beyond.  Although the pandemic will have moved on and the disruption will probably be less, we will still be dealing with disrupted timelines and a growing realization that although life may be more like it was before, life remains fundamentally uncertain.  Helping people re-establish timelines from past, to present, to future and engaging in goal directed behaviour in the face of ongoing uncertainty will be important therapeutic tasks. Likewise, we are understanding more and more how organizations, systems and teams contribute to both increasing and decreasing uncertainty by the way they behave and communicate.  Finally, for those who willingly or unwillingly have made friends with uncertainty during the pandemic, helping them stay friends with uncertainty as they move forward will be an important therapeutic task in many situations.', 16, 'published', '2026-01-07T03:49:46.729Z', '2026-01-09T23:50:41.012Z');

Involvement of parents/carers
Focus on identifying young people’s values
Problem solving and contracting, with parental involvement
Session by session workbooks for young people and their parents
Brief BA involves 6-8 weekly sessions of up to 1 hour, and a 30 minute review session one month later. Brief BA is simple to explain, easy to understand and reasonably straightforward to incorporate into an adolescent’s life.

In the past decade, there have been clear strategic attempts to better understand the mechanisms that lead some survivors to experience clinically significant FCR and to develop efficacious treatments for managing this understandable fear. Conquer Fear was a treatment developed to manage FCR in early stage cancer survivors who had been treated with curative intent and demonstrated high levels of FCR. Conquer fear draws from acceptance commitment therapy, meta-cognitive therapy and behavioural strategies. Conquer Fear was shown in a large randomized controlled trial to be superior to relaxation training in reducing FCR. Increasingly, it is clear that cancer is not the only illness where people fear a recurrence or progression of their illness and our recent work has suggested that fear of progression is surprisingly similar across other illnesses and strongly associated with depression, anxiety and poor quality of life.

This workshop will describe a model of fear of cancer recurrence, and examine the evidence that fear of progression is a transdiagnostic construct amongst those with chronic physical illness. From that theoretical position, the Conquer Fear program will be described. This workshop will outline ways to help patients to be able to think about their future with uncertainty and live a life that has meaning and value to them. Strategies from metacognitive therapy, that examine whether worry is helpful, harmful or controllable specifically in the context of FCR will be explored.

When the death is sudden and traumatic, risk for developing PTSD and prolonged grief disorder is increased.  Distressing images of the person may repeatedly come to mind and trigger intense sadness and yearning.  The images may be snapshots of the moments of death, painful points during an illness, or suffering the person may have experienced or the patient perceives them to have experienced. The images maintain distress because they link to worst meanings related to permanent change, continued suffering or loneliness, which are difficult to update in the context of repeated re-experiencing.  The persistent images block the capacity to recall memories of the deceased before they died and as such, prevent the loss memory from being more fully integrated with autobiographical memories.  When the images are in mind, patients feel as though they are losing their loved one all over again.  Transforming the distressing images is one of the core components of interventions used in trauma-focused cognitive therapy for PTSD to update the trauma memory and linked appraisals.  The aim of imagery transformation is to create a sense of continuity so that the patient can move forward with their grief, update appraisals linked to continued suffering, and update the trauma memory so that it becomes less threatening.  Imagery transformation used in CT-PTSD for traumatic bereavement is associated with high rates of recovery, is often described as life-changing, supports natural grieving, and can be adapted for remote delivery during pandemic working.

This approach recognizes that psychotherapy typically involves non-linear (rather than linear), bidirectional (rather than unidirectional), and dynamic changes of many (rather than only a few) interconnected variables. Effective therapy changes the entire system toward a stable and adaptive state by enhancing context-specific variability, selection and retention of biopsychosocial processes. Process-based CBT is, therefore, grounded in evolutionary science.

ACT is a unique transdiagnostic psychological intervention that comes from the contextual behavioural science tradition. ACT uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies, together with behaviour change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. It is concerned with helping individuals identify what is important to them and taking committed action in order that their behaviour is more consistent with their values. 

Rather than focussing on reducing symptoms or changing thoughts, ACT promotes skills that help people to  develop a more helpful relationship with their inner experience. It is rapidly developing a wide-ranging evidence base across numerous areas of clinical practice, with over 1000 peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials, and over 350 meta-analyses and systematic reviews. It has been shown to produce either equivalent or more effective outcomes when compared to other models of therapy.

Based on a wealth of research and literature from behavioural science, this workshop is designed for therapists working in physical/mental health care who want to enhance and develop their practice by developing skills in acceptance, mindfulness, and values procedures.

Through participation in this workshop, you will:

Understand the key concepts of ACT’s psychological flexibility model and the underlying science of relational frame theory
Develop a toolkit of acceptance and defusion techniques to work with difficult thoughts and feelings
Use mindfulness skills to help clients connect with present moment erxperiences
Engage clients in clarifying their values with a view to enacting purposeful behavioural change
The workshop will be highly interactive, involving a variety of methods including didactic teaching, experiential exercises, group work, and live/video demonstrations of therapeutic interventions. There is a strong emphasis on experiential learning and applying ACT concepts and techniques to oneself, therefore delegates should expect to engage in some personal, as well as professional, development. Participation in experiential exercises is an invitation, rather than an expectation.

Do we have a shared understanding of what it is? This workshop will explore what a complex case is and provide some clear guidance how to identify, formulate and respond to clinical complications.

Our basic view is that “complex case” is an over-used phrase. It gets used to describe a range of difficulties in providing CBT. This is very understandable because CBT is not an easy treatment to provide or receive. It takes a lot of training, skill and hard work to be a CBT therapist. It’s not easy. It takes a lot of trust, work and courage to benefit from CBT as a patient. It’s not easy. But difficulties are not necessarily complicated; they’re just difficult.

Complications arise when something obstructs the way that CBT usually works. It might be something unexpected or unusual. It might be factors that interact in a complicated way, for example, a client with panic disorder who is also receiving palliative care. Fear of death is usually over-estimated in clients with panic; the fact the client is nearing end of life is a complication that needs to be identified, formulated and worked with. It is not insurmountable; but it’s complicated. Standard CBT needs to be adjusted to address the complication.

It might be an issue in the client/therapist interaction, for example, a therapist who looks physically similar to the client’s abuser, so much so that the client feels unable to disclose the abuse. This is a real-life example that only came to light in a subsequent therapy. In this situation, the therapist’s appearance was a complication: it interacted with the client’s problems and obstructed the way that CBT usually works. The complexity was even higher because the therapist was unaware of it.

Working with this understanding of what complexity is, the workshop will explore two types of complication:

Problem complexity: when clients have multiple interacting problems. This can occur when clients have co-morbid disorders and it’s difficult to know what to prioritise. It can also be hard to stay focused on one target problem when other difficulties come to light during the therapy. Concurrent social and/or bio-medical problems can also disrupt the normal CBT treatment process.

Relational complexity: when there are complications in the therapeutic relationship. This occurs when something gets in the way of the collaboration needed for CBT to be effective. Client, therapist and service factors may all be at play. Sometimes the alliance barriers are apparent and understood, and sometimes they go un-noticed.

Goals
Reflect on one of your complex cases, past or current
Learn some key principles to identify and formulate complexity in CBT
Receive practical guidance on how to respond to complicated clinical sit
Observe role play demonstrations
Plan
Before the workshop, choose one of your complex cases, past or current, to reflect on during the day. There will be practical tasks throughout the day to consider different aspects of your case.

In the morning, we’ll explore what to do when clients have multiple problems, sometimes changing week to week, and it’s not obvious what to prioritise or how to stick with a target long enough for the client to benefit.

In the afternoon, we’ll explore what to do when there are complications in the therapeutic relationship – sometimes they’re obvious and sometimes they’re not.

Throughout the day, there will be clear guidance on do’s and don’ts and role-play demonstrations on how to address complications when they’ve been identified.', 16, 'published', '2026-01-07T03:49:46.798Z', '2026-01-13T01:53:00.741Z');

We first became interested in Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) in 1993 at Université Laval (Quebec) when we realized that for people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, uncertainty was part of the threat or threatening in and of itself. From a hunch came a questionnaire published in 1994, the Laval model of GAD with IU at its heart, then a treatment with several RCTs, and much more work on the model. It appears to have face validity, resonates as a concept with clinicians and patients alike and it is being used with different populations and in different areas of psychological research.&nbsp; Along with a range of collaborators, our current lines of research in this area include the nature of IU and&nbsp;its manifestations in everyday life;&nbsp;its possible origins and&nbsp;developmental course, its potential contribution to anxiety (including performance anxiety), depression, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorders; its possible role in physical health conditions,&nbsp;its presentation in non-western cultures, IU and healthy ageing, developing IU-specific treatment strategies, how people use internal body signals in response to uncertainty, etc.</span></p><p style="text-align: start;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">​In the last three years we have been looking at IU as a trans-situational factor and how people react to real life events that occur and have both uncertainty and threat as their defining features.&nbsp; Since the pandemic we have been developing and testing the model, developing interventions, and providing training for uncertainty distress. Ongoing tests of the model include the various uncertainties of the pandemic that also go beyond the virus (finances, occupation, social change, etc.), Long Covid, vaccines, climate change and extreme weather, and long-term health conditions, carers of people with dementia, and clinical training.</span></p>', 'Research Director, Doctorate in Clinical Psychology', '2026-01-03T11:27:33.578Z', '2026-01-03T11:27:33.578Z');
